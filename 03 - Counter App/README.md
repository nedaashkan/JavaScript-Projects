# Step Guide :

- Step 1 : Set up the basic HTML structure for the app with three buttons decrement , increment , reset and a one display area for the counter value.

- Step 2 : Add CSS styles to make the app look good, for example, by centering the elements and applying button styles.

- Step 3 : Write JavaScript code to add functionality to the app. This should include getting the counter display area and the increment/decrement buttons, creating a variable to store the counter value, and adding event listeners to the buttons to increment and decrement and rest the counter value and update the display accordingly.

- Step 4 : Test the app by opening the HTML file in your web browser and clicking the increment and decrement and rest buttons to ensure that the counter functionality is working as expected.
